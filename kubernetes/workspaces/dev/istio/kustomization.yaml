  ## An Istio service mesh is logically split into a data plane and a control plane.
  ## The data plane is composed of a set of intelligent Envoy proxies deployed as sidecars. These
  ## proxies mediate and control all network communication between microservices. They also collect
  ## and report telemetry on all mesh traffic.
  ## The control plane manages and configures the proxies to route traffic.

  ## Istiod provides service discovery, configuration and certificate management.
  ##
  ## Istiod converts high level routing rules that control traffic behavior into Envoy-specific
  ## configurations, and propagates them to the sidecars at runtime. Pilot (a component inside
  ## Istiod) abstracts platform-specific service discovery mechanisms and synthesizes them into a
  ## standard format that any sidecar conforming with the Envoy API can consume.
  ##
  ## Istiod security enables strong service-to-service and end-user authentication with built-in
  ## identity and credential management. You can use Istio to upgrade unencrypted traffic in the
  ## service mesh. Using Istio, operators can enforce policies based on service identity rather than
  ## on relatively unstable layer 3 or layer 4 network identifiers. Additionally, you can use
  ## Istioâ€™s authorization feature to control who can access your services.
  ##
  ## Istiod acts as a Certificate Authority (CA) and generates certificates to allow secure mTLS
  ## communication in the data plane.
